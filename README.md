## Description

-   **F-Food** This project was created to solve the Food demand at FPT University. F-Food connects the campus's store with students and lecturers. This is also an opportunity for me to enhance my programming skills and experiment with some new technologies that I've learnt recently (e.g. RESTful API, Material UI and ReduxToolkit) as well. This project achieved Most Promising Group at FPT Hackathon 2022.
